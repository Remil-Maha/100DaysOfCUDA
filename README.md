# 100 Days of CUDA Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of CUDA** challenge repository, where I document my journey learning CUDA programming from basics to advanced topics.

Each day, you will find code examples, explanations  aimed at mastering GPU parallel programming with CUDA.

## Repository Structure

- `Day01/`, `Day02/`, ..., `Day100/` :  
  Each folder contains the resources, code, and notes for that day.

- This `README.md` :  
  Overview of the challenge and objectives.

---

## Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of CUDA programming: threads, blocks, grids, and memory hierarchy.
- Learn how to optimize CUDA kernels and manage GPU resources.
- Apply CUDA to accelerate algorithms and real-world problems.
